# CLAP (C) Command Line Argument Processor
A lightweight argument processor for C in a header only format.
The full implementation is included by default, since most programs only parse arguments in main.

To use simply:
``` c
#include "clap.h"
```

If you want to exclude the implementation, you should define the macro:
``` c
#define CLAP_NO_IMPLEMENTATION
```


Example coming soon...
